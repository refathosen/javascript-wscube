        //         ***What is an operator ?
        // ==> An operator is a symbol that tell the compiler which arithmetic or logical operation to be performed between the respective operands.
        // ==> in easy language:: it will do operations between two operands

        // ***Types of OPERATORS in js ?
        // 1. Arithmetic operators[addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), modulus (%), and even exponentiation (**). You can also increment (++) or decrement (--) a value.]
        // 2.Logical operators[&& means "and", || means "or", and ! means "not". ]
        // 3.Ternary operators[condition ? value_if_true : value_if_false]
        // 4.Assignment operators[=,+=, -=, *=, and /=]
        // 5.Comparison operators[Comparison operators help you compare values and return a boolean (true or false). Examples include == for equal, != for not equal, === for strict equality (both value and type), and !== for strict inequality. You can also use <, >, <=, and >= to compare numbers.]
